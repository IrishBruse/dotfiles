# PR compose branch

## Create or update

When existing open PRs is not `none`, edit that PR instead of creating a duplicate.

The `git diff origin/main` section is the source of truth for what ships.
When the repo PR template is not `none`, fill it in for the body.

For update, use the current PR section for what is on GitHub today, dropping stale sections that no longer apply.

## Body

Compose the title from the diff and branch, not invented scope.
Compose the body using the layout inlined below from `body-format.md`.

## Apply

Always create new PRs as **drafts**.
Do not pass `--draft` on update, and do not change draft status when editing an existing PR unless the user asks.

Create:

```bash
gh pr create --draft --base main --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```

Update:

```bash
gh pr edit --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
```
